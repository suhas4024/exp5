The Sobel operator is a discrete differentiation operator used in image processing, primarily for edge detection. 
It highlights regions of the image where there is a significant intensity change, such as object boundaries or edges.
The operator uses convolution with two kernels to compute the gradient of the image in both the horizontal and vertical directions.
